The Dragon's Lair~
   You have stumbled into a dragon's lair! The mammoth cave has ended in a
truly gigantic chamber, and it seems a dragon has made its home in it. The back
of the cave is dominated by a huge nest, apparently made from whole trees. No
creature but a red dragon builds a nest so large. To the side, you can see
charred bits of armor, perhaps returned from the dragon's sensitive stomach.
