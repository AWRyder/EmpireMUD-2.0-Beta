tavern tipsy tortoise building inn~
the Tipsy Tortoise Tavern~
The Tipsy Tortoise Tavern stands precariously on the creature's back.~
   The tavern is a tall building and looks quite old. Large sections of the
walls have been repaired in different types of wood, likely sourced wherever
the tortoise happens to have roamed. The building is held to the massive
creature by a great leather strap, made from an animal so massive that the
strap reaches unbroken around the tortoise's shell. The tavern is loud enough
that you can nearly make out their song from here.

door tavern~
the tavern door~
The tavern door swings freely as the tortoise shakes.~
   The door swings back and forth as the tortoise sways, blocking little from
the outside. Its hinges are sturdy, perhaps imperium, although they don't match
the rest of the hardware of the rest of the building, so they must have been
replacements.

the shadow fountain~
A fountain of pitch-black water hovers in the air.~
   The fountain appears black as midnight, but has the soft babble and cool
touch of water. It spins and cycles in the air, free of any container, as if
gravity hasn't noticed it in this dark corner.

A boundless cornucopia of food sits on the counter.~
   The cornucopia sits on the counter, overflowing with breads, fruits, meats,

and is gone.
