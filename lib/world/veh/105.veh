the Polar Wind~
A huge icebreaker ship called the Polar Wind looms over you.~
   The Polar Wind is massive, with sails that look like they are made from
gossamer -- or, perhaps, from wind itself. The front of the ship has iron bars
to prevent the hull from being squeezed in icy waters. The rest of the hull has
a blue tint, perhaps from longterm exposure to cold.
