That Dammed River~
Yvain~
   Beavers have built a dam here and the rising river is causing floods! 
Killing their leader or destroying the lodge should drive them away, stopping
the flooding. You can use Chant of Nature to restore flooded tiles and Siege
Ritual to demolish dam tiles, but they will eventually return to normal on
their own.
